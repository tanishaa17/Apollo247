Introduction
We got the task to create a clone of “Appolo247.com” and show our skills of HTML, CSS and JavaScript which we have learnt till now at Masai School.
How we created the page
First, we have just decided how should we start it by adding important parts of the website in this short span of time and tried to maintain the proper communication.
For the same, we have just started it step by step by dividing everyone’s individual part of the website.
And we used to have mandatory meetings in the morning and evening to resolve the doubts if anyone have.
After completing that, we just tried to add some more styles and functionality to the page and then just merge it together.
How we communicated
For delivering a result-oriented output of any work/project communication between the team is the most crucial part.
We used slack whatsapp and zoom to communicate with each other.
The effective and goal-oriented approach towards communication made this task a lot easier for us.
Challenges we faced
We had to communicate remotely.
Having people from different different corners of the country is the most challenging part as we can have a lot of communication issues.
After that using Git-Hub very first time and push & pull the codes and then, merging it together was lil difficult in start.
The most importantly, adding all the JavaSript functionality to make a website for the very first time.
Overall Experience
It was a very nice to work with the ones, we did not even know and shared a great time together.
Had a person who could lead the team and took the responsibilities of all team members and done a great job.
And we just successfully created our first clone site.
